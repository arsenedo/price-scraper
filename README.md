# Why?
I wanted to sell stuff on ebay but while doing research on the best price to put, my brain was focusing only on really small or really high prices.

To cope with that, I needed to have a chart representation of existing price groups.

I didn't try to find a solution online, so I made my own thing.

# ACHTUNG!!!
For now is ugly af (both code and frontend) and works only with Ebay!
