# Why?
I wanted to sell stuff on ebay but I was mostly noticing really small or reall high prices.

To battle with that, I needed to have a chart representation of those price groups.

I didn't try to find a solution online, so I made my own thing.

# ACHTUNG!!!
For now is ugly af (both code and frontend) and works only with Ebay!
